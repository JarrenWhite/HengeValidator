## I've had a problem!!
This code was spun up in a day with very poor coding quality and practices and absolutely no tests.
All that to say: I'm not surprised there are issues.

Send me a message, or create a git issue, and I'll get on it.

## Can I use this code in my own app?
Please go ahead. If you do, feel free to let me know where it's being used, I'd love to know.
